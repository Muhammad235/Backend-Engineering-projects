## Task 1: REST API for a Library Management System

### Objective
Build a RESTful API for a library management system that manages books, authors, and users. It should also handle borrowing and returning books, with additional features like role-based access control, search, and caching.

### Requirements

1. **Environment**
   - Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

2. **Entities**
   - **Book**
     - `id`: Integer, primary key
     - `isbn`: String, required, unique
     - `published_date`: Date
     - `author_id`: Foreign key to Author
     - `status`: Enum [Available, Borrowed], required
   - **Author**
     - `id`: Integer, primary key
     - `name`: String, required
     - `bio`: Text, optional
     - `birthdate`: Date, optional
   - **User**
     - `id`: Integer, primary key
     - `name`: String, required
     - `email`: String, required, unique
     - `password`: String, required
     - `role`: Enum [Admin, Librarian, Member], required
   - **BorrowRecord**
     - `id`: Integer, primary key
     - `user_id`: Foreign key to User
     - `book_id`: Foreign key to Book
     - `borrowed_at`: DateTime, required
     - `due_at`: DateTime, required
     - `returned_at`: DateTime, optional

3. **API Endpoints**
   - **Books**
     - `GET /books`: Retrieve all books.
     - `GET /books/{id}`: Retrieve specific book by ID.
     - `POST /books`: Create a book (Admin/Librarian).
     - `PUT /books/{id}`: Update a book by ID (Admin/Librarian).
     - `DELETE /books/{id}`: Delete a book by ID (Admin).
     - `POST /books/{id}/borrow`: Borrow a book (Member, if available).
     - `POST /books/{id}/return`: Return a borrowed book (Member).
   - **Authors**
     - Similar CRUD operations for authors.
   - **Users**
     - Admin-only access to view and manage users.
     - `POST /login`: Authenticate and return a JWT/sanctum token.
   - **BorrowRecords**
     - View borrow records (Admin/Librarian).

4. **Additional Requirements**
   - Implement RBAC, search, pagination, validation, error handling, feature tests, and rate limiting.

## Task 2: News Aggregator API

### Objective
Build a RESTful API for a news aggregator service that fetches articles from various sources and provides endpoints for a frontend application to consume.

### Requirements

1. **User Authentication**
   - User registration and login with JWT/Sanctum.
   - API token authentication and password reset.

2. **Article Management**
   - Fetch articles with pagination, search/filter by keyword, date, category, and source.

3. **User Preferences**
   - Allow users to set and retrieve preferences (news sources, categories, authors).

4. **Data Aggregation**
   - Fetch articles from at least 3 APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, The Guardian, BBC News) and store locally.

5. **API Documentation**
   - Provide documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.

## Task 3: Automated Email Notification System with Cron Jobs

### Objective
Build a system that allows users to schedule automated email notifications to be sent at a future date using cron jobs.

### Requirements

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement registration and login with sessions.
   - Logged-in users can schedule email notifications.

2. **Email Scheduling**
   - Allow users to schedule emails with recipient, subject, body, and send date/time.
   - Use OOP principles (e.g., `Email` class with `scheduleEmail()`, `sendEmail()` methods).

3. **Cron Job**
   - Check for pending emails and send them at the scheduled time using SMTP.
   - Implement retries for failed email attempts.

4. **Database Design**
   - Tables: `users`, `scheduled_emails` with fields like recipient_email, subject, body, scheduled_time, status, attempts.

5. **Code Structure**
   - Use an MVC structure for organizing the code.

## Task 4: Travel Agency API

### Objective
Develop a RESTful API for managing travels and tours. Users can browse public travels and book tours.

### Requirements

1. **Models**
   - **User**
     - Fields: `ID`, `Email`, `Password`
   - **Roles** (Many-to-Many with Users)
   - **Travels**
     - Fields: `ID`, `IsPublic`, `Slug`, `Name`, `Description`, `NumberOfDays`
   - **Tours**
     - Fields: `ID`, `TravelID`, `Name`, `StartingDate`, `EndingDate`, `Price`

2. **Endpoints**
   - Private (admin) endpoint for creating travels, tours, and users.
   - Public endpoint for browsing travels and tours with filtering and sorting options.

3. **Note**
   - Use UUIDs as primary keys if possible.
   - Use integer values for tour prices (e.g., 99900 for â‚¬999.00).
